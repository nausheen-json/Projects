Stock Portfolio Analysis Project (using yfinance in Python)

Objective: Developed a stock portfolio analysis to compare and evaluate various stocks, providing insights into investment opportunities and risks.

Key Components:

Comparative Stock Analysis: Compared multiple stocks from different sectors to evaluate performance and growth potential.
SWOT Analysis: Conducted a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis for selected stocks to understand market position and future prospects.
Technical Analysis: Used technical indicators like moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and other metrics to assess stock trends and momentum.
Moving Averages & RSI Insights: Calculated moving averages (SMA, EMA) and RSI to analyze stock price patterns and overbought/oversold conditions.
Correlation Matrix: Built a correlation matrix to identify relationships between the selected stocks, helping to understand diversification potential and risk correlation.
Risk vs. Return Analysis: Assessed the risk and return profiles of each stock to make data-driven investment decisions based on volatility and returns.
Monte Carlo Simulations: Performed Monte Carlo simulations to predict stock performance over time, forecasting potential future returns under various market conditions.
Outcome: Provided in-depth insights into stock behaviors, enabling better-informed investment decisions and portfolio optimization strategies.
